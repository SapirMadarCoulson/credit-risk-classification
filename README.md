# credit-risk-classification


This project analyzes the credit risk of loans using a machine learning model, specifically logistic regression. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a loan being high-risk (defaulting) or healthy based on various features. A dataset containing information on loan applicants is used to train and evaluate the model.

The key objective of this analysis is to provide the company with a reliable tool for predicting whether a loan is healthy or at high risk, helping to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals.
